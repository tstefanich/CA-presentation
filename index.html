        <h1>Game Concept</h1>
        <p>
          Collective Action! is a performance based game project which uses a mobile website and large scale projection to invite groups of players to perform simple collective actions thematically related to the causes of, and solutions for climate change while responding to Northern Spark’s climate change topics at multiple locations throughout the festival. The game draws inspiration from the expansive history of non-competitive group games ranging from the new games foundation, to fluxus experiments and performances, and earth day activities.

        <h1>Climate Themes</h1>
      <p>Each physical location will be thematically related to a climate change issue as well as one of the Northern Spark Festival topics of focus. For example; in the Little Mekong neighborhood we will focus on the Northern Spark climate topics Interconnect and perceive in conjunction with the overarching water theme.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the overarching climate themes and the Northern Spark climate topics will give us n opportunity to not only visuallr reflect on climate issues, but more importantly, address them with thematic calls to action!</p>
      <ul><li><strong>Initial prompt:</strong> five players to lay down on the ground while a sixth participant’s helps each of the 5 players stand back up. </li>
      <li><strong>Thematic call to action:</strong> Players 1-5 lay on the ground, you have been captured by a rising tide and don’t know how to swim! – Player 6 you are in a rescue boat, row over to each of the other players and help them stand up and get into your boat!”</li></ul>

        <h1>Scoring</h1>
        <p>One of the key ways to see how all of the actions add up is through a scoring and tracking system which works on multiple levels. Game wide metrics and rankings are captured and visualized to reinforce and illustrate the idea of collective action to participants.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Game wide metrics: </strong></li>
            <li>Participant’s personal score which grows each time they perform.</li>
            <li>A location score for how many actions have been performed at each location throughout the festival.</li>
            <li>A global score for how many actions have been performed in total at all the locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Game-wide leaderboards:</strong></li>
            <li>Rank players based on how many total actions they have performed.</li>
            <li>Rank team play for another level of collective effort.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We want to engage players in play that encourages them to reflect on, and consider how, their individual actions can have larger impacts when performed in collaboration with others. </p>
          <p> We have also been discussing how to incorperate players cell phone energy use as a scoring metric. </p>
